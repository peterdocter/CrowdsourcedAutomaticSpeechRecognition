Creating HITs using the Eliciation Pipeline
WARNING:
set the boto Mturk Connection URL to sandbox.mturk in handlers/ElicitationPipeline.py to:
#HOST='mechanicalturk.amazonaws.com'
HOST='mechanicalturk.sandbox.amazonaws.com'
So that your hits don't cost you money. 

Prerequisites:
All you need to start running hits is a mongod instance running on a mongodb database. As long as there is an instance for pymongo to latch onto, you're good to go.

1.Run run() in handlers/EliciationPipeline.py
2.Load your source file via option #1, the loader expects prompts in the ResourceManagement prompt format:
";" at the beginning of the line means it is a comment
"(ALPHANUMERIC)" as the last word on the line should be the prompt id
Each prompt should be separatated by a new line
Each word should be space delimited.

Here is an example:
; 2 sentences used as dialect calibration material (not in Resource Management
; language model):
SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR (SA1)
DON+T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT (SA2)

3. Queue the prompts and submit the HITs with option #2. The size of the queue is the number of prompts that are included in each HIT. Currently the default is 10 prompts with x30 redundancy.

4. To retrieve the submitted assignments, select option #3. A full explanation of retrieving the assignments and grabbing the audio is detailed in GrabbingTheLatestEliciations.txt
